            There is <em>a lot</em> of information available online, but
            unfortunately, it's mostly either <strong>really old</strong>
            or <strong>really technical</strong>.

              <p>
                What's a "<em>web application</em>"?  Well, it's simply
                a program (or set of programs) that build web
                pages when requested.
                Google, for example, has a web application that
                builds a list of search results when you search for
                a specific term.
              </p>
              <p>
                We often say the pages generated by web applications
                are "<em>dynamic</em>."
                This distinction is to clarify that the page
                is generated when you request it.  It is (potentially)
                unique to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, when you log into your favorite social
                networking site, you see a list of your friends. This
                is dynamically generated based on the relationships
                you established through the site (which its
                web applications recorded into a database, then
                subsequently retrieve upon later visits).
              </p>
              <p>
                We can contrast this with <em>static</em> content, such
                as Javscript files, CSS stylesheets, and images. 
                These resources are always the same, no matter who
                requests them.
                As we'll see in greater details later, we usually
                allow web server software (such as nginx or Apache)
                to serve this static content, and leave our web
                applications free to handle the trickier tasks.
              </p>
            </aside>
          </div>

          <p>
            You can easily create your site using
            tools and technologies from the web's stone age, following
            some "CGI Scripting" tutorial near the top of google's
            search results[% footnote("
              Because the dynamic web was built largely on the back
              of Perl, there's no end of Perl+CGI tutorials written
              in the late 90s and linked zillions of times over.
              The unfortunate result is that finding good, modern
              information with google is well-nigh impossible.
              So I'm especially glad you found this!

            Eventually you will probably discover an unnecessarily long
            and hard lesson with an unhappy ending though.
            There's a reason things have evolved in the past decade.
          </p>
          <p>
            So maybe you could instead ask some veteran Perl web
            developers, "Hey, I want to create a robust, scalable,
            butt-kicking website; where do I start?"
            They'll tell you to use <a href="#plack">plack</a>.
            You'll then spend an hour or two searching through
            reference documents, each assuming you know and 
            understand another separate stack of documents.

            You'll get trapped in a vicious loop of nitty-gritty
            details and nobody will ever pull you out of it and
            tell you where to start.

            There are countless ways to use Perl to power your
            web site.
            This is especially true since Perl was one of the 
            earliest computer languages used to serve
            dynamic content. We've had a long time to try a lot
            of things.

          <p>
            We're going to take a walk with the ghosts of web
            development's past, present, and future.

            Be warned though, if you're a stickler for details and

            In looking at the tools of yesterday, we'll

            sites were written and deployed: CGI, Apache and mod_perl, and FastCGI.
            We will also simplify the complex histories and 
            try to understand these as a sequential evolution, to
            better grasp their strengths and  weaknesses
            and see how they came about, then fell out of favor.

          <p>
            In the earlest days of the web, it was terribly difficult
            to create dynamic content. In order to allow a web server to 
            dynamically respond to custom requests, people actually
            modified the source of the web server itself.
            This was not only time-consuming to
            implement, but it presented a lot of maintenance
            challenges.

            Some of these early web pioneers then came up with the Common Gateway Interface
            (CGI), which allowed them to create separate programs that 
            could be run by the web server.
            This made it simpler for people to develop and share custom web 
            applications.
            These early CGI programs were written in C,
            the low-level language of the web server.
          </p>
          <p>
            While C is very popular, and extremely powerful,
            it is nevertheless cumbersome and labor intensive for 
            certain types of tasks.
            
            Around the time CGI was picking up speed, so too was
            Perl becoming more popular and widely used.
            C's usage for web applications was short lived as
            people found Perl to be a perfect fit for
            processing web requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perl quickly became the defacto language for the web, and CGI
            its vehicle.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the web began to get more and more traffic, though,
            and as the demands
            for web applications required ever-increasing complexity,
            the limitations of CGI began to strain many servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically, as the web server receives each request, it
            forks a separate process to run the CGI script.
            Or said another way: it's quite inefficient.

            <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a>, the popular web server,
            offered an <a class="help_link" href="#help_api">API</a>
            to allow 3rd party software to plug into it.
            This was leveraged to create <a href="http://perl.apache.org/">mod_perl</a>, which embedded a persistent Perl interpreter in the web server.

              <p>
                Simply (though perhaps slightly inaccurately) said, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of agreed-upon functions you can call
                on a piece of software or a service.
                Apache, for example, provided an interface through which
                other peoples' code can interact with the web server, allowing
                that code to see incoming requests, modify the outgoing
                responses, and more.
              </p>

            This was significant because, unlike CGI, you could now write
            Perl web applications that continued to run (albeit idly)
            even after a request had been finished, and could
            therefore be reused for multiple requests.
          </p>
          <p>
            This eliminated much of the startup time
            and allowed for more efficient and quicker web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            But these benefits came with a cost.  Writing an Apache module
            is fairly complicated.  It easily trips up a novice programmer
            and gives them many opportunities to introduce bugs.
            And when it comes time to fix those bugs, debugging a mod_perl
            application can be quite an ordeal.
          </p>
          <p>
            And finally, an obvious drawback that shouldn't be overlooked
            is that a mod_perl application forever ties you to Apache.
            You will not have the opportunity to easily look for
            performance enhancements and greater efficiences
            (and therefore cost savings!) with alternative web servers
            such as <a href="http://www.nginx.org/">nginx</a> or

            Remember when we said using CGI, FastCGI, or Apache mod_perl is not
            recommended?
            Well, that's not entirely true.
          </p>
          <p>
            The important thing is to avoid writing our web application 
            <em>specifically for</em> CGI,
            or <em>specifically for</em> FastCGI
            or <em>specifically for</em> Apache.

            Yet another benefit of writing a PSGI-capable application
            is that you can wrap your code in a handler to
            serve it any way you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words,
            <strong>your PSGI web application can be deployed as a CGI,
            FastCGI, mod_perl Apache handler</strong>,
            and more.
